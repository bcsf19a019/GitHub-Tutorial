    <img src="git add.png" alt="git add">

    <h2>Git Commit</h2>
    <p>After staging the files to local repository. We have to commit the changes. This is done by following command:
    </p>
    <b>git commit -m "Commiting Changes" *</b>
    <br>
    <img src="git commit.png" alt="git commit">

    <h2>GitHub Repository</h2>

    <h2>Adding Origin</h2>
    <p>To Store our Repository on GitHub we have to add a origin. This is done by following command: </p>
    <b>git remote add origin https://github.com/bcsf19a019/GitHub-Tutorial.git</b>
    <p>Above link will vary from repository to repository</p>
    <img src="git origin.png" alt="">

    <h2>Main Branch</h2>
    <p>Before Pushing data to the GitHub repository we have to make the main Branch. This is done by the following
        command: </p>
    <b>git branch -M main</b>
    <br>
    <img src="git Main.png" alt="">

    <h2>Push</h2>
    <p>After making Main branch we have to push the data on the GitHub. This is done by the following command: </p>
    <b>git push -u origin main</b>
    <br>
    <img src="git push.png" alt="">

    <h2>Mutation, Adding and Removing Files</h2>
    <p>Whenever changes are made in a file or new files are added or some files are deleted they have to be added,
        cmmitted and pushed again.
        Otherwise the changes made to
        the file are not made in repository</p>
    <p>For Example Some Changes are made in my index.html file and some png images are added to file after last Commit.
        So I have to add, commit and then push it to Repository.
    </p>
    <p>Before Adding, Commiting and Pushing. The changes made in index.html are not made in GitHub Repository as shown
        in figure below: </p>

    <p>Afeter Adding, Commiting and Pushing. The changes are made in index.html file and new .png files are added in
        GitHub Repository as shown in
        figure below: </p>

    <img src="Mutation-4.png" alt="">

    <img src="Mutation-5.png" alt="">

    <h2>Cloning</h2>
    <p>We can Clone a Repository using git by the following command: </p>
    <b>git clone https://github.com/bcsf19a019/GitHub-Tutorial.git</b>
    <p>The Link varies from Repository to Repository.</p>
    <img src="git clone.png" alt="">

    <h2>Pulling</h2>
    <p>To fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that
        content we use the following command: </p>
    <b>git pull https://github.com/bcsf19a019/GitHub-Tutorial.git</b>
    <p>The Link varies from Repository to Repository.</p>
    <img src="git pull.png" alt="">

    <h2>Branching</h2>
    <p>Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of our changes.</p>
    <p>To make a new Branch following command is used: </p>
    <b>git branch b1</b>
    <p>Here, the last parameter is Branch name.</p>
    <p>To List all Branches following command is used: </p>
    <b>git branch</b>
    <p>To change Branch we are working on following command is used: </p>
    <b>git checkout b1</b>
    <p>Here, the last parameter is Branch name.</p>
    <img src="git branch.png" alt="">

    <h2>Merging</h2>
    <p>Now After checking out to b1. I made some Changes to that branch now inorder to merge them following command is
        used: </p>
    <b>git merge b1</b>
    <br>
    <img src="git merge.png" alt="">

    <h2>Log</h2>
    <p>To show a list of all the commits made to a repository the following command is used: </p>
    <b>git log</b>
    <img src="git log.png" alt="">

    <h2>Merge Conflict</h2>
    <p>A merge conflict is an event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code
        between two commits. Git can merge the changes automatically only if the commits are on different lines or
        branches.</p>

    <p>I made a change in styles.css on git website then I made a change in styles.css in local repository and when I
        tried to pull a merge conflict occured and then I resolved it.</p>

    <h2>Git Status</h2>
    <p>We can check the status of the repository at any stage. For this the following command is used: </p>
    <b>git status</b>
    <img src="git status.png" alt="">
