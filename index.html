    <h2>Adding Origin</h2>
    <p>To Store our Repository on GitHub we have to add a origin. This is done by following command: </p>
    <b>git remote add origin https://github.com/bcsf19a019/GitHub-Tutorial.git</b>
    <p>Above link will vary from repository to repository</p>

    <h2>Main Branch</h2>
    <p>Before Pushing data to the GitHub repository we have to make the main Branch. This is done by the following
        command: </p>
    <b>git branch -M main</b>
    <br>

    <h2>Mutation and Adding new Files</h2>
    <p>Whenever changes are made in a file or new files are added it has to be added, cmmitted and pushed again.
        Otherwise the changes made to
        the file are not made in repository</p>
    <p>For Example Some Changes are made in my index.html file and some png images are added to file after last Commit.
        So I have to add, commit and then push it to Repository.
    </p>
    <p>Before Adding, Commiting and Pushing. The changes made in index.html are not made in GitHub Repository as shown
        in figure below: </p>
